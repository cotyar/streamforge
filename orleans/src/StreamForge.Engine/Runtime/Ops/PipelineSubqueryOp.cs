/// Plan 004 N2/N3/N4's pipeline-mode subquery join stage — semi/anti membership (`[NOT] IN`/`[NOT] EXISTS`,
/// <see cref="JoinKind.Semi"/>/<see cref="JoinKind.Anti"/>) and scalar value lookup (uncorrelated N3 /
/// equality-correlated N4, <see cref="JoinKind.Scalar"/>) share ONE mechanism here, per the task's "same
/// rolling-snapshot rule ... one shared subquery materialization helper if that falls out naturally": both
/// need "the current state of a windowed subquery's most recent emission, indexed by key, tested against at
/// arrival" — membership doesn't care about the row payload (only whether a key's bucket is non-empty),
/// value lookup does (it returns the matched row's fields) — everything else (batch-replace snapshot
/// timing, key-NULL handling) is identical.
///
/// THE ROLLING-SNAPSHOT RULE (plan 004 N2/N3/N4's pipeline "honesty rule", exactly as shipped): the
/// subquery side MUST be a windowed derived query (Validator enforces this — IsTransitivelyWindowed).
/// Its nested nested executor (wired exactly like plan 004 N1's derived-source nesting) is driven by
/// ExecutorImpl the same way any derived role is; the difference is what happens to what it emits — see
/// <see cref="OnRightBatch"/>: instead of feeding each emitted row through the ordinary per-row join path,
/// ExecutorImpl collects the WHOLE emission batch from one OnEvent/AdvanceWatermark call and hands it here
/// as one unit, which WHOLESALE REPLACES this op's snapshot (never merges/accumulates across batches) — "a
/// rolling snapshot replaced on each inner emission batch". An EMPTY batch (the normal steady state between
/// window closes) leaves the snapshot untouched — it keeps serving the most recently closed window's
/// membership/value until the next non-empty batch replaces it. A side-A row is tested/evaluated against
/// WHATEVER snapshot is live AT ITS OWN ARRIVAL (<see cref="OnLeft"/>) — no buffering, no waiting for a
/// "matching" snapshot batch; this is a deliberate, documented approximation (not exactness against some
/// global order) appropriate for a best-effort streaming semi-join/scalar-lookup, not a correctness
/// contract about which specific window a given A-row logically "belongs" to.
///
/// STATE: <see cref="_snapshot"/> — join-key string → the inner query's currently-live emitted row(s) under
/// that key (a list only because a composite N4 correlation key hashes on its FIRST component alone, with
/// any additional components checked via <see cref="_residual"/> at lookup time — see
/// Planner.BuildScalarJoin's doc comment; in every other case it holds at most one entry). Wholesale-
/// replaced, never incrementally mutated, by <see cref="OnRightBatch"/>.
