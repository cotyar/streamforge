// interfaces (StreamsForge.Abstractions/Facades.cs) that shared/StreamsForge.Api's endpoints depend on —
// the Dapr counterpart of orleans/src/StreamsForge.Host/Facades/OrleansFacades.cs.
//
//   - ICatalogFacade / IUserStoreFacade: resolve an ActorProxy for the "catalog"/"users" singleton actor
//     once (per adapter instance) and forward every call, packing multi-argument members into the
//     actor's request records and unwrapping ActorResult<T> failures into a thrown
//     InvalidOperationException (see ActorResult<T>'s class doc for why this boundary uses an explicit
//     result type rather than relying on Dapr's own actor-exception marshaling).
//   - IPipelineReadFacade: real as of W6 (DaprPipelineReadFacade below) — forwards to the pipeline's
//     PipelineActor.
//   - ITableReadFacade / ITableHistoryFacade / IArrangementMetaFacade: stubbed in this wave (see
//     StubFacades.cs) — TableActor/TableHistoryActor don't exist until W7, and partitioned execution
//     (arrangements) is Orleans-only (decision D-F).
//
// Plan 006 (ingestion connectors) W3-B addendum: IConnectorStatusFacade's real implementation,
// DaprConnectorStatusFacade, is defined below (next to DaprPipelineReadFacade — same per-call proxy-
// resolution shape) but registered by Actors/ConnectorRuntimeSetup.cs's AddServices, not by
// AddDaprFacades() above — see that method's own doc comment for why.
