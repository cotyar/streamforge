/// <see cref="AccessGuard"/> for its own action at its own scope, with the pipeline's <c>Tags</c> so
/// <c>tag:finance</c> scopes match.
///
/// <para><b>The scope is the pipeline's NAME, not the <c>{id}</c> in the route.</b> That is a real

/// <c>Guid.NewGuid().ToString("n")</c>, so an id is opaque. An entitlement grammar whose whole point is
/// <c>prod-*</c> versus <c>dev-trades</c> is a grammar about names — scoping on the id would leave
/// prefix scopes matching nothing at all on this entity type, i.e. the feature would be present and
/// useless. Where the pipeline cannot be loaded the route segment is used verbatim as the scope, which
/// only ever narrows the answer (the caller is about to get a 404 anyway).
/// Upgrade path if a GUID-scoped grant is ever wanted (an admin UI generating them, say): check the id
/// as a second scope and OR the two, which is strictly additive to every decision made here.</para>
