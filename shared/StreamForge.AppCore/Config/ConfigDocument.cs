// [GenerateSerializer] — these types never cross grain/actor transport, they live only at the

// wire shape and ConfigComposer/ImportPlanner for how documents combine and diff against a
// running catalog.

/// <see cref="Include"/> lists relative paths to other documents that are composed BEFORE this
/// one (see <see cref="ConfigComposer.ComposeWithIncludes"/>) — this document (the includer)
/// always wins per-entity over anything its includes declare. <see cref="Sources"/> reuses
/// <see cref="SourceDefinition"/> directly (sources are already id-less — nothing to strip);
