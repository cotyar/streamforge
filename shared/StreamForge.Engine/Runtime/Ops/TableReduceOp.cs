/// Maintains per-group running aggregate state for table-mode GROUP BY (no window: groups live forever,
/// updated by every contributing delta) — plan 003 M1's suggested op set: "TableReduceOp (running
/// GROUP-BY aggregates incl. multiset MIN/MAX + retraction emission)". A GROUP BY-less aggregate is a
/// single implicit global group (GroupValues = []). On any group change this emits a retraction (old row,
/// -1) — skipped the very first time a group produces output — followed by an assertion (new row, +1);
/// when the group's total contributing weight reaches (or starts at) zero, only the retraction is emitted
/// and the group is dropped.
///
/// Mechanical relocation of the pre-M1 `TableGroupOperator` into the explicit-op shape: same per-row
/// algorithm (unchanged), `OnDelta` batched into `OnBatch`, implements <see cref="ITableOp"/>.

/// IZAggregator[] Aggregators, long TotalWeight }. GroupValues and TotalWeight are plain data; the
/// Aggregators array is NOT yet plain data — see this M1 pass's residue report: CountZAggregator/
/// SumZAggregator/AvgZAggregator hold private scalar accumulators, MinMaxZAggregator holds a private
/// SortedDictionary multiset. A future M2 checkpoint needs either (a) a ToState()/FromState() pair added
/// to IZAggregator (cheap: count/sum/avg state is 1-3 scalars each; MIN/MAX's multiset already IS its own
/// checkpoint, just needs exposing), or (b) rebuilding aggregator state by replaying the group's
/// contributing deltas from a checkpointed log — out of scope for M1, flagged here for M2's design.
